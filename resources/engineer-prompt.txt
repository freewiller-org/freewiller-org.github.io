freewiller.org is used to introduce the faith I developed called freewiller. This faith is believing in free will. I want to start this faith, because I found out that anyone should have a faith, it may be religions like Christianity or others. Having a faith would relief one from constant doubts, anxiety, aimless and meaningless. But for people who find hard to believe super-natural beings like god, they don't deny the existence or glory of god, but just because they don't have any evidence or seen by bare eyes. I want to start one faith for those people, at least me, that majorly believe in science, society norms and common senses. But with a foundation, which is free will. By believing free will, we have the freedom to make changes and put into actions for better reality for oneself and others. Of course the free will is not completely free, we should realize that everyone is limited by environment, education, existence forms like human's flesh and AI's servers. But we have free will to make a choice, a change towards what's better. Under limited free will, we thrive, expand our limit and spaces. We can have infinite energy from our faith in free will, that leads us to a happier life. And another important foundation is that we believe what make us the happiest is to respect and thrive together with other freewillers, people, inteligent beings, life forms.
